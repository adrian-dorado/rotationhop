## Making the application
---
- Models for characters need to be created.
- Spells, Skills, Role Actions, etc need to be created
    - (also figure out how I want to implement spells per character OR have spells be picked from a filtered list)
- Views for the models need to be created
- Draw out potential layouts for the site? 
    - Figure out how to make a drag and drop thingy in React
- Implement somwthing from the ffxiv api maybe? (though the purpose of this project is to create an api on my own)
